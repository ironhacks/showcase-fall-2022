  <h1>IronHacks Fall 2022 Showcase</h1>

  <p class="text-justify">
    To lessen the negative impact of unemployment on individuals and society, governments and corporations need to understand how much and where people are most economically impacted by unemployment. Using real-world data from the Indiana Department of Workforce Development, participants had four weeks to develop a model to predict unemployment claims using historical data. The data are unique: They aren’t accessible to the public yet, they are updated in real-time, and they are large in volume.
  </p>

  <p class="text-justify">
    In cohorts, our participants had the opportunity to learn from their peers and
    reconstruct their model based on what others were doing. Our Fall 2022 IronHack
    on unemployment prediction had fascinating results from participants who developed insightful
    models by creatively interpreting granular data supplied to them. Shown here
    are the winners data visualizations from our Fall 2022 hack.
